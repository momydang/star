# Kakarot MVP

## Scope

The scope of this MVP is to provide a minimal implementation of the Kakarot
protocol. The MVP will be able to run widely used EVM bytecode program.

We will use the code of simple contracts as a reference for the MVP:

- a simple Counter contract (increment, decrement)
- ERC-20 token
- ERC-721 token
- UniswapV2 smart contract
